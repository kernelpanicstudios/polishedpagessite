polishedpagessite
=================

Simple website built around the Polished Pages API.

The mission of Polished Pages is to facilitate collaboration between writers
and editors by providing a simple interface for uploading documents, reviewing
and proofreading documents, and reading the resulting feedback. Most of these
capabilities are powered by the reusable, open-source Polished Pages API.

The Polished Pages API is designed to be a simple RESTful interface to the
documents, proofreading data, and metadata that form the core of the Polished
Pages application.
